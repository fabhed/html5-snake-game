To create a snake game in HTML5 and serve it on port 8000 with Python, we will need the following files:

1. `server.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will use Flask to serve our HTML5 game on port 8000.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML5 file that contains the game. It will include the game logic written in JavaScript.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs to run.

Let's start with the `server.py` file:
